Description: Polaric Server: AIS data plugin. 
 The "Polaric Server" is mainly a web based service to present APRS 
 tracking information on maps and where the information is updated at real-
 time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search
 and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server 
 program (APRS daemon). 
 .
 This is a plugin that can read AIS data from a TCP stream and present 
 AIS vessels as moving points on the map. It is used on aprs.no with data from 
 the Norwegian Maritime Authority.
