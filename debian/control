Description: Polaric Server: AIS data plugin. 
 The "Polaric Server" which is mainly a web based service to present APRS 
 tracking information on maps and where the information is updated at real-
 time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search
 and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server 
 program (APRS daemon). 
 .
 This is a plugin that adds a channel for receiving AIS data and showing 
 them on the map along with APRS data. It uses the DMA AisLib 
 (https://github.com/dma-ais/AisLib) to parse and interpret 
 AIS messages.
